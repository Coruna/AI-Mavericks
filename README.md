# Smart Customer Support Mentor

This project aims to improve customer support by utilizing Azure OpenAI Service. The objective of this project is to provide insights into the areas where the employee can improve their performance and offer tips on how they can do so. By doing this, the employee can enhance their skills, and ultimately improve the customer's experience.

When a customer calls a customer support line, the conversation will be recorded. ChatGPT will analyze the conversation and give the employee a rating on performance, and tips for improvement. ChatGPT is trained on how to give feedback about the conversations using prompt engineering techniques.
