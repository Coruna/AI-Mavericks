"Hi there, can you tell me a bit more about the issue when they did start happen? OK, let me take a look at your computer remotely. Can you please download the remote desktop software from our website and run it? Great. Can you give me the access code that's displayed on your screen? I need that to connect to your computer. It looks like there are some malware and adware programs on your computer that are slowing it down. I'm going to remove them for you now."
